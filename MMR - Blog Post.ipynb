    "# Making Math \"Rock\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models are all the rage right now, and I've always been fascinated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been playing and listening to music for most of my life, and the more music theory I learn, the more it becomes apparent how much structure there is in music.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I'll attempt to generate songs in the math rock genre using, well, math. [Math rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock) is one of my favorite genres of music - it's a modern progressive style of rock that often features elements such as [odd time signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature#Complex_time_signatures), [polyrhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm), [counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint), unconventional song structures, and so on. [Melody 4 by Tera Melos](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JeVTUELKzEIsPtEWd1VDU?si=5f9d43510d4f4dce) is, in my opinion, a great example that characterizes many elements of the genre. It's not for everyone, and some say it just sounds like noise. This is beneficial because the results of the model are likely to be just noise, but the underlying structure of the songs used in the training data is going to be much more difficult to learn than a conventional rock song.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that I'll be using some of the code from the [TensorFlow tutorial on generating music with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/music_generation). I think it does a good job with processing and preparing the data for the models (especially with using [windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#window) to create training sequences) and with using a custom loss function to encourage non-negative outputs from the model. This project is not just duplicating that tutorial as it also includes converting songs from audio to MIDI, generating songs with a variational autoencoder (VAE), and adding effects to the generated songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert mp3 files to MIDI files with Spotify's [Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch) library\n",
    "2. Convert MIDI files to a NumPy array\n",
    "3. Train two models:\n",
    "    1. An long-short term memory (LSTM) network to predict the note(s) at the next time step\n",
    "    2. A variational autoencoder (VAE) network to learn the latent space of the songs\n",
    "4. Generate songs with the following methods\n",
    "    1. **LSTM:** Passing a seed song snippet to the model and then continuously predict the note(s) at the next time step for a pre-determined amount of time\n",
    "    2. **VAE:** Randomly sampling from the latent space and then decoding the sample to a song\n",
    "5. Convert the generated song from a NumPy array to MIDI\n",
    "6. Convert the MIDI file to an audio file\n",
    "7. Add special effects with Spotify's [Pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard) library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately my training data for this project isn't great. This requires mp3 files, and I mostly started listening to math rock after I got a Spotify subscription and stopped purchasing mp3s so I don't have a large library of songs to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing power for training the model is also limited. I'm training this on a desktop without a GPU, so we will train smaller networks with fewer training epochs."

    "## Converting mp3 files to MIDI\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do this with Spotify's [Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch) library. This is what originally sparked the idea for this project because it made it feasible and easy to turn audio files into a numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library uses a model to predict the the notes being played - specifically the start/stop times, pitch, and the velocity (how hard a note is played). It's surprisingly fast and lightweight, and it only took a few minutes to convert the songs I wanted to use for my training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more, I recommend listening to the [Spotify Engineering Podcast (NerdOut)](https://open.spotify.com/show/5eXZwvvxt3K2dxha3BSaAe) episode on [Basic Pitch](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4wDDgWn037xjuq4Hr0u6a3?si=8a93b14952d546ca) and checking out the [announcement post](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/06/meet-basic-pitch/) and [website](https://basicpitch.spotify.com/) for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with some library imports and then grab the paths to the MP3 files we want to use for the training set before using basic pitch."

    "I mentioned earlier that we chose not to represent the data as a piano roll because it would result in a very sparse array, and you can see how the higher and lower pitches contain no notes. It's also worth noting that the notes look fairly choppy. The [function](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch/blob/4855f26131c259a8795b2ae8124491ace83788c9/basic_pitch/inference.py#L262C1-L262C1) we're using from Spotify's [Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch/tree/main) library to convert the audio files to MIDI files has [a few parameters](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch/blob/4855f26131c259a8795b2ae8124491ace83788c9/basic_pitch/inference.py#L280) we can try changing to see if we can reduce this choppiness and get a better representation of the data."

    "Ultimately, we just want a classification model that predicts the probability of each note/pitch being played at each time step. We'll expand upon this more in the song generation section for how to continue generating songs beyond just the next timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of models that can be used to generate music. Here we are going to try a few models in increasing levels of complexity. I'm doing this because it helps explain different concepts and components, and it gives options in case you are looking to borrow from this project.\n",

    "Lastly, we're going to use Keras to build the models. Keras is a high-level API (built on top of TensorFlow) that makes it easy to build and train neural networks, and I think the simplicity and readability of the code is preferable for a blog post over more complex libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow."

    "### Simple LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most basic model we'll build, and it had surprisingly good results! It's just a single layer [long short-term memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) network with 56 units that is fed to a dense layer that gives the probability of each note being played at the next timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs are a type of [recurrent neural network (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) that are designed to handle sequential data by \"remembering\" data from earlier in the sequence. I recommend reading Christopher Olah's [blog post on LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) if you want to learn more. I'm a big fan of his work, and I highly recommend the [Distill](https://distill.pub/) journal he cofounded to help explain research and concepts in a more interactive way than traditional papers. [Here is an example on memory within RNNs](https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/) that is germane to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs are very useful for music generation because what is played at the next timestamp is most likely dependent on more than what was played at the previous timestamp. For example, if a song is in the key of C major, then there are only 7 possible notes that can be played if we ignore accidentals and octaves. If the model only pays attention to the previous note played, then it may not know if the song is in C major and will have a more difficult time distinguishing which notes could be played next. Another example is that songs  often have structure in the form of [chord progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression), so if a model is trying to learn a song that is using the 12 bar blues chord progression (I-I-I-I-IV-IV-I-I-V-IV-I-V), then it will likely struggle if it only pays attention to the previous chord played.\n",

    "### Variational autoencoder (VAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs can generate decent music, but research has shown other methods to be more effective. One of these methods is a [variational autoencoder (VAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder#Variational_autoencoder_(VAE). This is a type of [autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) that is designed to learn a latent space that can be used to generate new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are neat. They exemplify one of the largest strengths of neural networks - automatic feature engineering. They work by learning a compressed representation of the input data (referred to as the latent space, they can also be considered embeddings) through a neural network that tries to predict its input given a model architecture that initially restricts itself (referred to as the encoder) and then re-expands (referred to as the decoder). Here is a quick diagram of the typical model architecture for an autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.compthree.com/images/blog/ae/ae.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "*Credit: [Steven Flores](https://www.compthree.com/blog/autoencoder/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model is trained, the encoder can transform data into the latent space, and the decoder can attempt to reconstruct the latent space back into the original form. This has a number of different use cases, but we're primarily interested in the generative capabilities of the decoder and a few fun things we can do with the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VAEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders don't restrict how the latent space is represented, and this results in a fixed latent space representation that often results in difficulty generating sensible reconstructions if provided data that is dissimilar to the data that it was trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, below is an example of reconstructing the interpolations between the latent space for different numbers from the MNIST handwritten data set with the decoder. For example, if the latent space for the number 0 is `[10, 2, 10]` and the latent space for the number 1 is `[20, 6, 2]` and we're interpolating in three steps, then the interpolated latent spaces would be `[12.5, 3, 8]`, `[15, 4, 6]`, and `[17.5, 5, 4]`. Note that all digits shown are the reconstructed from the latent space using the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/MacalusoJeff/MacalusoJeff.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/autoencoderInterpolation.png?raw=true\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how most of the interpolated digits don't look like an actual digit. Remember, this is because autoencoders learn a *fixed* latent space representation that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are an extension of autoencoders that models the latent space as a probability distribution, and this allows the VAE to work better as a generative model. Specifically, the probability distribution will allow new data points to resemble the training data with additional variability introduced. The latent space in VAEs is also encouraged to have a continuous and smooth structure, so sampling from the latent space is more likely to produce realistic generations. TODO: Reword this, maybe include a link to a blog post\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of re-performing the interpolations on the latent space of the handwritten digits with a VAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/MacalusoJeff/MacalusoJeff.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/vaeInterpolation.png?raw=true\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the reconstructions from the interpolations actually resemble digits now. The reconstructions of some of the digits (especially 3, 4, 5, and 9) are not as good as those from the previous autoencorder, and that shows how autoencoders and VAEs are suited to different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolating the latent space has interesting possibilities for music. The first thing that came to mind for me is with genre blending. What would a mix between a math rock and a doom metal sound like? We could of course also try blending individual songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also generate realistic data by just sampling from the latent space and feeding that to the decoder. We'll get into the mechanics of generating songs in the next section, but this will allow us to not have to provide seeds to the model like we would have to in our LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our VAE\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be loosely based on the [MusicVAE](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae) model architecture created by Adam Roberts, Jesse Engel, Colin Raffel, Curtis Hawthorne, and Douglas Eck. I recommend reading their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05428) and checking out the [blog post on MusicVAE](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae). We won't directly copy the hierarchical part of their model architecture because I'm not concerned about generating longer samples, but we may play with the latent space from the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will also be much smaller than MusicVAE's due to hardware limitations. MusicVAE's encoder (section 3.1 in their paper) is a two layer LSTM with 2048 units each fed into a fully connected layer with 512 units, and their decoder (section 3.2) is a bit more complex due to the hierarchical nature, but it involves multiple LSTMs with 1024 units each. My computer (that doesn't have a GPU) struggled to train a simple LSTM with 56 units, so we'll stick to a smaller model since I'll be training it on a virtual machine.\n",
